ABSTRACT = {This article presents a systematic literature review that expands and updates a previous review on the application of machine learning to laboratory medicine. We used Scopus and PubMed to collect, select and analyse the papers published from 2017 to the present in order to highlight the main studies that have applied machine learning techniques to haematochemical parameters and to review their diagnostic and prognostic performance. In doing so, we aim to address the question we asked three years ago about the potential of these techniques in laboratory medicine and the need to leverage a tool that was still under-utilised at that time.},

abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) allows the analysis of complex and large data sets and has the potential to improve health care. The clinical microbiology laboratory, at the interface of clinical practice and diagnostics, is of special interest for the development of ML systems.
Aims
This narrative review aims to explore the current use of ML In clinical microbiology.
Sources
References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, arXiV, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to November 2019.
Content
We found 97 ML systems aiming to assist clinical microbiologists. Overall, 82 ML systems (85%) targeted bacterial infections, 11 (11%) parasitic infections, nine (9%) viral infections and three (3%) fungal infections. Forty ML systems (41%) focused on microorganism detection, identification and quantification, 36 (37%) evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility, and 21 (22%) targeted the diagnosis, disease classification and prediction of clinical outcomes. The ML systems used very diverse data sources: 21 (22%) used genomic data of microorganisms, 19 (20%) microbiota data obtained by metagenomic sequencing, 19 (20%) analysed microscopic images, 17 (18%) spectroscopy data, eight (8%) targeted gene sequencing, six (6%) volatile organic compounds, four (4%) photographs of bacterial colonies, four (4%) transcriptome data, three (3%) protein structure, and three (3%) clinical data. Most systems used data from high-income countries (n = 71, 73%) but a significant number used data from low- and middle-income countries (n = 36, 37%). Performance measures were reported for the 97 ML systems, but no article described their use in clinical practice or reported impact on processes or clinical outcomes.
Implications
In clinical microbiology, ML has been used with various data sources and diverse practical applications. The evaluation and implementation processes represent the main gap in existing ML systems, requiring a focus on their interpretability and potential integration into real-world settings.}

    abstract = { Editor's Note: In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Paul Bourbeau and Nate Ledeboer provide an informed review of an exciting new concept in clinical microbiology, the use of instrumentation to automate the front-end processing and workup of specimens submitted to a laboratory for analysis. The potential value of such instrumentation includes the possibility of substantial cost savings, standardization of initial specimen processing, more rapid and consistent provision of both identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, and a diminished risk for laboratory-acquired infections. However, as with any new diagnostic modality in clinical microbiology, there now exists a pressing need for investigations aimed at elucidating the performance characteristics of this new technology. Going forward, it will be imperative that laboratorians assess this new technology in objective, comparative, and preferably prospective clinical studies. Such studies will be necessary to define the true, rather than perceived or hoped-for, value of front-end and total laboratory automation in clinical microbiology. The Journal of Clinical Microbiology enthusiastically awaits submission of manuscripts that report the results of such investigations. Historically, the trend toward automation in clinical pathology laboratories has largely bypassed the clinical microbiology laboratory. In this article, we review the historical impediments to automation in the microbiology laboratory and offer insight into the reasons why we believe that we are on the cusp of a dramatic change that will sweep a wave of automation into clinical microbiology laboratories. We review the currently available specimen-processing instruments as well as the total laboratory automation solutions. Lastly, we outline the types of studies that will need to be performed to fully assess the benefits of automation in microbiology laboratories. }

ABSTRACT = {When deploying a model for object detection, a confidence score threshold is chosen to filter out false positives and ensure that a predicted bounding box has a certain minimum score. To achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, most neural networks use a rather low threshold as a high number of false positives is not penalized by standard evaluation metrics. However, in scenarios of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that require high confidence scores (e.g., due to legal requirements or consequences of incorrect detections are severe) or a certain level of model robustness is required, it is unclear which base model to use since they were mainly optimized for benchmark scores. In this paper, we propose a method to find the optimum performance point of a model as a basis for fairer comparison and deeper insights into the trade-offs caused by selecting a confidence score threshold.},

title = {Image Processing: Facilitating Retinanet for Detecting Small Objects},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Detecting small objects is a challenging task in object detection due to low spatial resolution and interference by background. Specifically, one-stage detectors struggle with small objects for they generate worse candidate bounding boxes. In this paper, several modifications are made to the original Retinanet to tackle the problem. Dilated convolutional layers are added to the backbone to get fined-grained features along with semantic information. The gradient of loss function is increased near the origin to enhance the quality of candidate boxes for small objects. A novel feature fusion method is also proposed to directly guide low-level features with semantic information. Significant improvement of 5.1 mAP can be seen when evaluating on MOCOD small object dataset, which contains a large amount of small objects. Our method can be easily migrated to other backbone networks with feature pyramids for detecting small objects.}
